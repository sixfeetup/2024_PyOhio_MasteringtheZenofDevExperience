# Ideal Developer Experience {.r-fit-text .semi-filtered data-background-image="images/Chuttersnap Unsplash.jpg"}
* Set up in a few minutes (`git clone && tilt up`)
* Enough resources (RAM, CPU, disk) to develop and run the application
* Containerized (all developers run exactly the same stack)
* Continues integration and deployment for a quick feedback loop
* Automatic preview environment for PRs
* Use the same tools to debug Dev, QA, and Production environments

# "Scratch Your Own Itch" {.r-fit-text .semi-filtered data-background-image="images/Erwan Hesry Unsplash.jpg"}
* Dev laptops can be underpowered (and couldn't run large software stacks)
* The dev environment is not set up with remote development in mind
* Docker permission issues
* Little support for developing inside containers 
* Difficulty debugging in the QA environment

# Kubernetes to the Rescue? {.r-fit-text .semi-filtered data-background-image="images/Frank McKenna Unsplash.jpg"}


# Kubernetes is Declarative {.r-fit-text .semi-filtered data-background-image="images/Jeffrey Blum Unsplash.jpg"}

* As a building plan does for construction, it requires you to describe the desired state in what is known as a manifest.
* You are the architect, and Kubernetes is the builder.
* No manual commands are required for deployment.
* It does more! Like the maintenance man on your new home, it actively maintains the state.

# Let's Peek at some YAML

# Kubernetes Standardizes Deployment {.r-fit-text .semi-filtered data-background-image="images/Kurt Cotoaga Unsplash.jpg"}

* Use the same tools to deploy to all environments
* Application developers and DevOps engineers speak a common language
* Easily switch from local to remote dev environment
